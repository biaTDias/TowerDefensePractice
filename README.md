# A Tower Defense Game

A small project for me to learn better how to work with the [Godot game engine](https://godotengine.org/). Goal is to make a Tower defense game with 5 levels.

Started **21/07/2021** following the [tutorial by Game Development Center youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFdpCGbrVXI&list=PLZ-54sd-DMAJltIzTtZ6ZhC-9hkqYXyp6&index=2&t=8s&ab_channel=GameDevelopmentCenter)
